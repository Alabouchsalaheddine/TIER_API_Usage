#### In this notebook we are going to interact with the TIER API, in order to get some information about the location of escooters and their availability.
#### We can also show that by periodically saving the data about every escooter we can make some conclusions about the number of rides that TIER makes everyday, and so their daily turnover.
#### We can also go further, by trying to analyze these data to find out which day the service is used the most, and if the weather influences its use.
